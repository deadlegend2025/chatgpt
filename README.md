The application provides a real-time chat interface where users can interact with an AI chatbot, replicating ChatGPT functionalities. The front end, built with React.js and styled with Tailwind CSS, ensures a responsive and user-friendly experience. On the backend, Express.js handles API requests, while MongoDB stores user data and chat histories. The integration with Google Gemini enhances the chatbot's natural language processing abilities.
